# Document-Search

This implementation uses the famous <b>Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency</b> Algorithm which is responsible for creating a great search engine.
In this example, the user can use a local folder of documents (books, papers etc.) where he can use a string query as an input to search a specific word or even a sentance inside these documents. The output will show a list of the most relevant content of those documents based on the searched query. Thanks to the score mechanism of the algorithm, we can have precise results of what we are searching for inside these documents.
